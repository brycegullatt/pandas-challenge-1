# pandas-challenge-1
Module 4 Challenge

# Purpose
This exercise was intended to practice various Pandas fucntions and operations while exploring and transforming sample data in multiple ways.  Practicing this data manipulation demonstrates both the flexibility and the power of these tools to mold raw data into clear categories ready for summary and analysis.

# Credit
I received assistance and guidance from Brandon Wong on the basic functions and concepts applicable to this assignment, as well as pieces of code in Parts 1 and 2.  I received significant assistance from Lindelwe Myeza to create the Summary DataFrame in Part 4.  She helped me craft the code for this item and understand the concepts behind the code's performance and functions.  I greatly appreciated the assistance I received.  Other portions of the code may reflect examples found in the exercises and lessons for Module 4 as I studied those items to assist completion of the assignment.
